## Finished

[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) **Miran Lipovača**

> Good introduction to Haskell, but the absence of exercises makes it pedagogically unsound. Oftentimes, I find myself unable to retain the knowledge that the author was earnestly to disemminate.

[Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) **Robert C. Martin**

> This book provides you with a set of guiding principles for writing clean code. Always keep your functions small and don't ever repeat yourself. Choose meaningful and consistent names. If you can follow these, you will write cleaner code than most developers out there. Remember, cleanliness is next to godliness.
